# KUKA simulator

The KUKA simulator emulates the shitty KUKA windows environment in a better environment so that developers may rejoice and develop in peace.

Also useful if you don't have a physical KUKA robot to test the rest of the ROS2 stack.

The most fundamental IP addrs and ports are:

- `0.0.0.0:54601` - (this box) Command server
- `some.external.telemetry.sink:60002` - (external) Telemetry server

Have a blast!
